%% To do - mini new analysis projects
% try to define dynamic threshold for each fish, to find motor related cells

% for example, try to define the most-motor cluster, and use their activity
% as motor regressors. 

% additionally, using activity during OMR-forward somehow may help find
% forward swim regressor, which is sometimes confounded with L/R

%% Not urgent
% is zres not imported from data but set in GUI???

%% Figure making goals
% - stim-lock scripts for fig 3

% - try fig4f_tSNE on new computer!

% FindClustermeans to replace old FindCentroid - where to replace?? Now
% already used for left trace plot

% - fig5B: bar plots with error bars, anat masks to count cells

%% Coding goals
% - double check mean+-error plot in left plot... more shading??
% - when ranking is set (by rank by stimlock for example), the colormap menu
% is not updated when colormap is changed

% - check Fish 4 for bugs - couldn't run it in fig3_3wayplot!!!!

% - artifacts: whether the not-z-scored signal is actually weak?!

%% Questions for Aaron:
% - double check mean+-error plot in left plot... more shading??

% - regressor ctrl: permuted, already built in; good for anything? what was
% fig2 red control histogram again?

% - any use for my fMasks? 

%% Problem fish
% fish 1 shocked, fish 4 no fictive
% fish 2 missing left
% fish 12,14 missing right
% fish 15,17,18 dispersed

% should count cells from hindbrain

why
